Leap Year Checker :
Write a JavaScript program that checks if a given year is a leap year. Leap years have a special property
where they have an extra day, February 29th. The program uses conditional statements to determine
whether the input year is a leap year or not. (Do not use loops or functions)
Your program checks for leap years based on the following conditions:
If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it's a leap year.
If the year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.
Expected Outputs :
input : 2023 output: 2023 is not a leap year.
input : 2024 output: 2024 is a leap year.
